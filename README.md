# Garbage-Image-Classification
Garbage Image Classification

Built a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify RGB garbage images by category using TensorFlow and Keras. Explored the impact of convolutional layer parameters (padding, stride, kernel size) on model performance. Tested multiple architectures with convolutional, normalization, and dropout layers. For comparison, also trained a multilayer perceptron (MLP) using scikit-learn.
